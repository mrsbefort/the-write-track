<h2 align="center">By: Gabrielle Befort</h2>

Created a dashboard that uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data. Type any location and see the weather anywhere. This uses `localStorage` to save any cities you searched for.

The following images demonstrates the application functionality: 








## Reference websites used to learn: 

In this challenge I spent some time learning how to style while using bootstrap. Particularly with changing text colors and adding opacity/transparent to background colors, which I liked. I also tried to continue learning the hidden feature and implementing it to hide the saved cities until used in my code. I had my first experience with adding videos to my background, which I found how to do using a quick google search.
